# Jira Tracker

Talks to Jira Cloud via REST API v3 through `scripts/jira.mjs` — every command below is
`node scripts/jira.mjs <command> [flags]` run from the project root, invoked with Bash.
The script owns API calls, JQL/ADF/field handling, and output formatting; relay its
stdout to the user as-is on success, and its stderr message as-is on failure (exit code
non-zero). Don't reimplement any of that logic by hand or call the Jira REST API directly.

Config lives at `.jira/config.local.json` (baseUrl, email, apiToken, defaultProjectKey).
If it's missing, every other command errors and points to `init`; if it still has
placeholder/blank values, they error listing what's missing — show the user that
message and stop, don't try to work around it.
